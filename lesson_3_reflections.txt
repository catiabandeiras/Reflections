1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

It would be good to have a remote repository for me to access my work files from different locations and computers instead of always dragging my external drive around, and also to show it to collaborators.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because some changes by collaborators might not be relevant enough to be included in my code, especially if we are changing the same file. This can create conflicts.
